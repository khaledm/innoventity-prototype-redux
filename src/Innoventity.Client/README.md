# InnoventityClient

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.23.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with Jest, use:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

To generate coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Running end-to-end tests

The project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing.

**Prerequisites**: The backend API must be running on `http://localhost:5001` before running E2E tests.

```bash
# Start the backend API (in a separate terminal)
cd ../Innoventity.API
dotnet run

# Run E2E tests
npm run e2e
```

For more E2E testing options and troubleshooting, see the [E2E README](e2e/README.md).

**Interactive UI Mode** (recommended for debugging):
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```
